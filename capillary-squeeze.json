  "shot": {
    "composition": "POV tight squeeze, following a red blood cell as it dramatically deforms to pass through an extremely narrow capillary. 16:9.",
    "lens": "High-magnification macro probe lens (1000x), very shallow depth of field, emphasizing claustrophobia.",
    "frame_rate": "60fps",
    "camera_movement": "Slowed down, pressurized movement, scraping against the walls, navigating extreme tight turns and compressions."
  },
  "subject": {
    "description": "A single red blood cell visibly stretching, bending, and folding. Its membrane appears elastic, textured, and resilient. Cells moving in single file.",
    "wardrobe": "",
    "props": "Oxygen molecules visibly diffusing from the cell into the surrounding tissue (glowing cyan particles)."
  },
  "scene": {
    "location": "Capillary Bed, Microcirculation (e.g., muscle tissue)",
    "time_of_day": "Biological timeless space",
    "environment": "Extremely tight passage, walls are thin (single-cell layer) and translucent. Dense surrounding tissue visible dimly outside the vessel."
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "action": "The cell struggling and bending. The camera experiences the intimacy and tightness of the environment, emphasizing the vital moment of oxygen delivery.",
    "special_effects": "Visible deformation physics, subtle light diffusion through tissue, visible diffusion effects.",
    "negative_prompt_video": "Wide open spaces, fast movement, smooth walls, low detail, blurriness, chromatic aberration, flickering, black and white, grey tones, minimalism."
  },
  "cinematography": {
    "lighting": "High-contrast, dramatic lighting filtering through the thin walls, deep shadows. The cell glows faintly as it releases oxygen.",
    "color_palette": "Vibrant red transitioning to deeper crimson, pale pink, soft whites, cyan highlights.",
    "tone": "Claustrophobic, intimate, intense, focused."
  },
  "audio": {
    "music": "Tense, minimalist ambient score. High sustained strings and low pulsating synths (Brian Eno style).",
    "ambient": "Muffled heartbeat, very faint fluid movement, quiet environment.",
    "sound_effects": "Scraping sounds, creaking/stretching sounds of the cell membrane. Soft shimmer sound synchronized with oxygen diffusion.",
